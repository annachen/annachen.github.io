Hi, I'm Anna and welcome to my website :)

I'm a researcher and engineer in artifical intelligence / machine learning, specifically in computer vision. I've had some exposure in natural language processing and robotics as well, thanks to the different types of products I have worked with.

Since a few months ago I've been taking some time off from work and exploring topics that interest me. Possibly due to the constraint I have by being at home with only 2 GPUs at my disposal, I'm interested in methods that'd allow deep learning to generalize better, train more efficiently, better reuse previously learned knowledge, modular, online and continual learning, etc.

Besides, I'm also interested in applying AI to art-related applications, since I have been (or want to be) an artist my whole life. Some topics that I've been reading about are sketch understanding, scene understanding, style transfer, 3D modeling and 2D animation.

If you would like to contact me regarding anything on this website (or any other subject), please reach out to anna1110 at gmail dot com. You can also find my code at [GitHub](https://github.com/annachen).
