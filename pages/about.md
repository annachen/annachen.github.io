Hi, I'm Anna and welcome to my website :)

I'm a researcher and engineer in artifical intelligence / machine learning, specifically in computer vision. I've had some exposure in natural language processing and robotices as well, thanks to the different types of products I have worked with.

Since a few month ago I've been taking some time off from work and exploring topics that interest me. Possibly due to the constraint I have by being at home with only 2 GPUs at my disposal, I'm interested in methods that'd allow deep learning to generalize better, train more efficiently, better reuse previously learned knowledge, use less resource, or use less (labeled) data.

Besides, I'm also interested in applying AI to art-related applications, since I have also been (or want to be) an artist my own life. Some topics that I've been reading about are sketch understanding, scene understanding, style transfer, modeling and 2D animation.
